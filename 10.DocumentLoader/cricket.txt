From emerald fields where summer sun descends,
A game of timeless grace, where friendship blends.
The sound of leather meeting willow bright,
A sporting ballet played in fading light.
Beneath the bails, the stumps stand sentinel high,
A theatre built where hopes and shadows lie.

The bowler strides, a rhythm born of toil,
The pitch a canvas, yielding to the soil.
He spins the sphere, a mystery in flight,
A curved trajectory, designed for spite.
The batsman waits, a figure cool and keen,
Eyes fixed upon the leather, sharp and clean.
He checks his stance, prepared for what may come,
The slow, deliberate beat of a summer drum.

The crowd exhales—a sudden, rushing sound,
As the white cherry arcs and hits the ground.
A defensive tap, a careful, measured block,
Or the mighty swing that shatters time and clock.
A boundary struck! The fielders chase in vain,
The scarlet scorebook registers the gain.
The quick exchange, a run that’s bravely dared,
The single point for which the sweat is shared.

But doom may lurk in moments swift and deep,
A sudden catch where fielders spring and leap.
The ball hangs high, a question in the air,
A breathless silence, heavy with despair.
The umpire’s finger, raised in solemn plight,
A dismissal signaled, ending day and fight.
The slow, long walk back to the wooden shed,
The silence broken by the words unsaid.

We speak of Tests, the five-day, arduous test,
Where patience is the virtue held the best.
Where lunch and tea become the markers set,
In battles fought that crowds will not forget.
And then the flash of Twenty20’s quick embrace,
A frenetic speed, a furious, short race.
The helicopter shot, the scoop that skims the wire,
The modern game consumed by white-hot fire.

From Lord’s to Melbourne, Eden Gardens' roar,
The love of cricket spills from shore to shore.
The dusty plains, the pristine, manicured lawns,
A hundred rules that follow countless dawns.
It is a story told in flannel white,
Of honour, skill, and sheer, enduring might.
A noble sport, by custom long defined,
The longest, gentlest poetry of humankind.

The Ground itself, a temple neatly framed,
Where history's echoes constantly are claimed. 
The quiet pavilion, timbered, dark, and grand,
A place for legends born across the land. 
The sight screens white, a stark and formal stage, 
Where every boundary turns a turning page. 
The roller smooths the centre, slow and vast, 
Preparing lines that destinies are cast. 
The worn-out gloves, the helmet, scarred and tough, 
A hundred stories whispered, quite enough.

The Fan's loud roar, a wave that crests and breaks, 
For every wicket fallen, run that makes. 
From balcony seats to distant grassy mound, 
The colours fly where loyalty is found. 
The patient vigil kept throughout the day, 
The hopes and fears that simply will not stray. 
They pack the stands with flags of nation proud, 
Lost in the cheers of a collective crowd. 
They know the stats, the averages, old and new, 
The tapestry of history they review.

And sportsmanship, the code that binds the game, 
To walk before the umpire calls your name. 
The gesture quick, the nod of the respect, 
For fierce competitors you must elect. 
The hand shake firm, when the final ball is done, 
The shared relief for battles fought and won. 
A greater victory than the score alone, 
The courtesy on which the game has grown. 
A testament to patience, skill, and nerve, 
The silent, noble lesson that they serve.
