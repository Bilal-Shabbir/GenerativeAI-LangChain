Project Zenith Internal Launch Report - Q4 2025

Phase I: Product Overview and Goal Setting
Project Zenith is the codename for our new flagship offering: a secure, cloud-native data observability platform. The core objective is to reduce customer Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for data pipeline failures by 40% compared to industry standard tools. Zenith achieves this through its proprietary "Fusion Indexing" algorithm, which correlates telemetry from source systems (databases, message queues, and ETL jobs) in real-time.

Phase II: Technical Specifications
Zenith operates on a microservices architecture running entirely on Kubernetes. It requires a minimum of 8 CPU cores and 16GB of RAM for the initial deployment tier. Data ingestion scales linearly, handling up to 50,000 events per second (EPS) per node. All customer data is encrypted using AES-256 and stored in geographically redundant zones (US-East and EU-West). The primary database used for storing metadata is PostgreSQL, version 14.7.

Phase III: Deployment and Customer Support
We are targeting three major initial customers: GlobalCorp, TechWave Solutions, and Apex Analytics. The official General Availability (GA) date is set for December 15, 2025. Tier-1 support will be handled by the specialized "Astra Team," which has undergone three weeks of intensive training on Fusion Indexing diagnostics. All deployment guides are finalized and available in the internal Confluence space under the tag "Zenith-Launch-2025."

Phase IV: Key Personnel
The project was led by Sarah Chen (Head of Engineering), with primary architecture design handled by David Rodriguez. Marketing and customer messaging were overseen by Evelyn Reed. For any critical issues during the GA period, the escalation contact is David Rodriguez, reachable at extension 743.
